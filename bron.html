    <br><p><h3>Bro be fr, LeBron isn’t just a basketball player — he’s a hoop deity, 
        a 6’9” demigod hand-crafted in a lab by the basketball gods themselves. 
        This man dropped 30 while filing taxes, helping Bronny with homework, 
        and curing world hunger on the side. You could put LeBron on a team with 4 folding chairs 
        and they’d still make the playoffs. His IQ? Galactic. Vision? 20/LeGOAT. 
        Aging backwards like a wine-sipping time traveler. We don’t deserve him.</h3></p>

    <h3>LeBron James could step on the court in house slippers and still drop a 40-point triple double while tweeting 
        mid-game. Man breathes and gravity thanks him. Defenders don’t guard him—they just witness. 
        This isn't a player; this is Basketball.exe running at god mode settings. Put him in a time machine and 
        he's giving Jordan, Wilt, and Larry Bird 50 each, in sandals. His haters? Fuel. His legacy? Biblical. 
        The NBA? Just a side quest in the LeNarrative</h3>
